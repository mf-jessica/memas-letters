## About the Collection

Welcome to our digital collection of family correspondence. This collection features letters from my great-grandmother, Lela Florence Steele, to her daughter, Catherine Steele Lineberger, written between 1973 and 1974. Originating from Gibsonville, North Carolina, these letters provide a glimpse into the family's everyday life, interactions with local residents, and commentary on regional and national events of the time.

In addition to the letters, youâ€™ll find various items such as newspaper clippings and birthday cards that enrich the context of this correspondence.

This project came about after my grandmother's passing when my mother asked for my assistance in organizing and preserving these letters. The goal is to create an accessible record of our family's history, allowing future generations to connect with the past. We invite you to explore these documents and learn more about our family's story.
